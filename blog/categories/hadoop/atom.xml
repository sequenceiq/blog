    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/09/09/yarn-schedulers-demystified-part-2-fair</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In our previous blog post we have been demystifying the <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/22/schedulers-part-1/">Capacity scheduler internals</a> &ndash; as promised in this post is the Fair scheduler’s turn. You can check also our previous post to find out how fair is the Fair scheduler in real life <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/16/fairplay/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You might ask why YARN schedulers are so important for us? Recently we have released and open sourced the industry&rsquo;s first SLA policy based autoscaling API for Hadoop clusters, called <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/27/announcing-periscope/">Periscope</a> &ndash; and part of the project is based on schedulers, <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> and our contribution to Apache YARN.</p>

<h2>The Fair Scheduler internals</h2>

<p>The FairScheduler&rsquo;s purpose is to assign resources to applications such that all apps get &ndash; on average &ndash; an equal share of resources over time.
By default the scheduler bases fairness decisions only on memory, but it can be configured otherwise. When only a single app is running
in the cluster it can take all the resources. When new apps are submitted resources that free up are assigned to the new apps,
so that each app eventually on gets roughly the same amount of resources. Queues can be weighted to determine the fraction of total
resources that each app should get.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Although the CapacityScheduler is the default we can easily tell YARN to use the FairScheduler. In yarn-site.xml
```
<property></p>

<pre><code>  &lt;name&gt;yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.FairScheduler&lt;/value&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></property>
<property></p>

<pre><code>  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/etc/hadoop/conf.empty/fair-scheduler.xml&lt;/value&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></property>
<code>``
The FairScheduler consists of 2 configuration files: scheduler-wide options can be placed into</code>yarn-site.xml<code>and queue settings in the
</code>allocation file` which must be in XML format. Click <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html">here</a>
for a more detailed reference.</p>

<h3>Few things worth noting compared to CapacityScheduler regarding queues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Both CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler supports hierarchical queues and all queues descend from a queue named <code>root</code>.</li>
<li>Both uses a queue called <code>default</code> as well.</li>
<li>Applications can be submitted to leaf queues only.</li>
<li>Both CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler can create new queues at run time, the only difference is the how. In case of the CapacityScheduler
  the configuration file needed to be modified and we have to explicitly tell the ResourceManager to reload the configuration, while the
  FairScheduler does the same based on the queue placement policies which is less painful.</li>
<li>FairScheduler introduced scheduling policies which determines which job should get resources at each scheduling opportunity. The cool thing
  about this that besides the default ones (&ldquo;fifo&rdquo; &ldquo;fair&rdquo; &ldquo;drf&rdquo;) anyone can create new scheduling policies by extending the
  <code>org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.SchedulingPolicy</code> class and place it to the classpath.</li>
<li>FairScheduler allows different queue placement policies as mentioned earlier. These policies tell the scheduler where to place the incoming app
  among the queues. Placement can depend on users, groups or requested queue by the applications.</li>
<li>In FairScheduler applications can be submitted to non-existing queues if the <code>create</code> flag is set and it will create that queue, while the
  CapacityScheduler will instantly reject the submission.</li>
<li>From Hadoop 2.6.0 (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1495">YARN-1495</a>) both schedulers will let users to manually move
  applications across queues.<br/>
  <code>Side note:</code> This feature allows us to re-prioritize and define SLAs on applications and place them to queues where they get the enforced
  resources. Our newly open sourced project <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/27/announcing-periscope/">Periscope</a> will add this
  capability for static clusters besides dynamic ones in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>The event mechanism is the same as with CapacityScheduler &ndash; thus I&rsquo;m not going to take account on the events &ndash; and if you check the handler methods
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity/CapacityScheduler.java#L956">here</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/FairScheduler.java#L1134">here</a>)
you can notice that they look fairly the same.
```java
@Override
  public void handle(SchedulerEvent event) {</p>

<pre><code>switch (event.getType()) {
case NODE_ADDED:
  if (!(event instanceof NodeAddedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  NodeAddedSchedulerEvent nodeAddedEvent = (NodeAddedSchedulerEvent)event;
  addNode(nodeAddedEvent.getAddedRMNode());
  recoverContainersOnNode(nodeAddedEvent.getContainerReports(),
      nodeAddedEvent.getAddedRMNode());
  break;
case NODE_REMOVED:
  if (!(event instanceof NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent nodeRemovedEvent = (NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent)event;
  removeNode(nodeRemovedEvent.getRemovedRMNode());
  break;
case NODE_UPDATE:
  if (!(event instanceof NodeUpdateSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  NodeUpdateSchedulerEvent nodeUpdatedEvent = (NodeUpdateSchedulerEvent)event;
  nodeUpdate(nodeUpdatedEvent.getRMNode());
  break;
case APP_ADDED:
  if (!(event instanceof AppAddedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  AppAddedSchedulerEvent appAddedEvent = (AppAddedSchedulerEvent) event;
  addApplication(appAddedEvent.getApplicationId(),
    appAddedEvent.getQueue(), appAddedEvent.getUser(),
    appAddedEvent.getIsAppRecovering());
  break;
case APP_REMOVED:
  if (!(event instanceof AppRemovedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  AppRemovedSchedulerEvent appRemovedEvent = (AppRemovedSchedulerEvent)event;
  removeApplication(appRemovedEvent.getApplicationID(),
    appRemovedEvent.getFinalState());
  break;
case APP_ATTEMPT_ADDED:
  if (!(event instanceof AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent appAttemptAddedEvent =
      (AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent) event;
  addApplicationAttempt(appAttemptAddedEvent.getApplicationAttemptId(),
    appAttemptAddedEvent.getTransferStateFromPreviousAttempt(),
    appAttemptAddedEvent.getIsAttemptRecovering());
  break;
case APP_ATTEMPT_REMOVED:
  if (!(event instanceof AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent appAttemptRemovedEvent =
      (AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent) event;
  removeApplicationAttempt(
      appAttemptRemovedEvent.getApplicationAttemptID(),
      appAttemptRemovedEvent.getFinalAttemptState(),
      appAttemptRemovedEvent.getKeepContainersAcrossAppAttempts());
  break;
case CONTAINER_EXPIRED:
  if (!(event instanceof ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected event type: " + event);
  }
  ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent containerExpiredEvent =
      (ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent)event;
  ContainerId containerId = containerExpiredEvent.getContainerId();
  completedContainer(getRMContainer(containerId),
      SchedulerUtils.createAbnormalContainerStatus(
          containerId,
          SchedulerUtils.EXPIRED_CONTAINER),
      RMContainerEventType.EXPIRE);
  break;
default:
  LOG.error("Unknown event arrived at FairScheduler: " + event.toString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<h3>NODE_ADDED &amp;&amp; NODE_REMOVED</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same as in CapacityScheduler, adjusts the global resources based on whether a node joined or left the cluster.</p>

<h3>APP_ADDED</h3>

<p>Application submission is slightly different from CapacityScheduler (well not on client side as it&rsquo;s the same there), but because of
the queue placement policy. Administrators can define a <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementPolicy.java">QueuePlacementPolicy</a>
which will determine where to place the submitted application. A QueuePlacementPolicy stands from a list of <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java">QueuePlacementRules</a>.
These rules are ordered meaning that the first rule which can place the application into a queue will apply. If no rule can apply the
application submission will be rejected. Each rule accept a <code>create</code> argument in which case it&rsquo;s true the rule can create a queue if it is missing.
The following rules exist:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L124">User</a>:
  places the application into a queue with user&rsquo;s name e.g: root.chris</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L140">PrimaryGroup</a>:
  places the application into a queue with the user&rsquo;s primary group name e.g: root.hdfs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L160">SecondaryGroupExistingQueue</a>:
  places the application into a queue with the user&rsquo;s secondary group name</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L188">NestedUserQueue</a>:
  places the application into a queue with the user&rsquo;s name under the queue returned by the nested rule</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L258">Specified</a>:
  places the application into a queue which was requested when submitted</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L282">Default</a>:
  places the application into the default queue</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/QueuePlacementRule.java#L324">Reject</a>:
  it is a termination rule in the sequence of rules, if no rule applied before then it will reject the submission</li>
</ul>


<p>ACLs are also checked before creating and adding the application to the list of <code>SchedulerApplications</code> and updating the metrics.</p>

<h3>APP_REMOVED</h3>

<p>Simply stops the application and sets it&rsquo;s final state.</p>

<h3>APP_ATTEMPT_ADDED</h3>

<p>The analogy is the same with the CapacityScheduler that application attempts trigger the application to actually run. Based on the
allocation configuration mentioned above the <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/MaxRunningAppsEnforcer.java">MaxRunningAppsEnforcer</a>
will decide whether the app is placed into the <code>runnableApps</code> or the <code>nonRunnableApps</code> inside of the queue. <code>MaxRunningAppsEnforcer</code> also
keeps track of the runnable and non runnable apps per user. Attempt states are also transferred from one to another.</p>

<h3>APP_ATTEMPT_REMOVED</h3>

<p>Releases all the allocated, acquired, running containers (in case of <code>ApplicationMaster</code> restart the running containers won&rsquo;t get killed),
releases all reserved containers, cleans up pending requests and informs the queues. <code>MaxRunningAppsEnforcer</code> gets updated as well.</p>

<h3>NODE_UPDATE</h3>

<p>As we learned from CapacityScheduler <code>NodeUpdateSchedulerEvents</code> arrive every second. FairScheduler support asynchronous scheduling on a
different thread regardless of the <code>NodeManager's</code> <code>heartbeats</code> as well. We also learned the importance of the <code>Allocation</code> method which
issues the <code>ResourceRequests</code> of an application and in this case it does exactly the same as in case of CapacityScheduler. You can read
about the form of these requests there. At each node update the scheduler updates the capacities of the resources if it&rsquo;s changed, processes
the completed and newly launched containers, updates the metrics and tries to allocate resources to applications. Just like with CapacityScheduler
container reservation has the advantage thus it gets fulfilled first. If there is no reservation it tries to schedule in a queue which is
farthest below fair share. The scheduler first orders the queues and then the applications inside the queues using the configured
<a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/tree/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/policies">SchedulingPolicy</a>.
As I mentioned in the configuration section there are 3 default policies available:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/policies/FifoPolicy.java">FifoPolicy</a>
  (fifo) &ndash; Orders first by priorities and then by submission time.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/policies/DominantResourceFairnessPolicy.java">DominantResourceFairnessPolicy</a>
  (drf) &ndash; Orders by trying to equalize dominant resource usage.
  (dominant resource usage is the largest ratio of resource usage to capacity among the resource types it is using)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/policies/FairSharePolicy.java">FairSharePolicy</a>
  (fair) &ndash; Orders via weighted fair sharing. In addition, Schedulables below their min share get priority over those whose
  min share is met. Schedulables below their min share are compared by how far below it they are as a ratio. For example, if job A has 8
  out of a min share of 10 tasks and job B has 50 out of a min share of 100, then job B is scheduled next, because B is at 50% of its
  min share and A is at 80% of its min share. Schedulables above their min share are compared by (runningTasks / weight).</li>
</ul>


<p>SchedulingPolicies can be written and used by anyone without major investment to how to do it. All it takes is to extend a
<a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/SchedulingPolicy.java">class</a>
and place the implementation to the classpath and restart the <code>ResourceManager</code>. Even though it&rsquo;s easy to do and it&rsquo;s not a major investment
the fairness will depend on it thus the effect will be major, so you should really consider it. After the decision of which application should
get resources first the game is pretty much the same as with the CapacityScheduler. First it tries to allocate container on a data local node
and after a delay on a rack local node and in the end falling back to an off switch node.</p>

<h3>CONTAINER_EXPIRED</h3>

<p>Cleans up the expired containers just like it would be a finished container.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>We might do a Part 3 post about the FIFOScheduler, though that&rsquo;s really straightforward &ndash; nevertheless, let us know if you&rsquo;d like to read about. As we have already mentioned, last week we released <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/periscope/">Periscope</a> &ndash; the industry’s first SLA policy based autoscaling API for Hadoop YARN &ndash; all these features we have blogged about are based on our contribution in Hadoop, YARN and Ambari -so stay tuned and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sequenceiq">Facebook</a> for updates.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/09/05/apache-ambari-1-7-0-ea/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-05T16:37:37+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/09/05/apache-ambari-1-7-0-ea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we use <a href="http://ambari.apache.org/">Apache Ambari</a> every day &ndash; it’s our tool to provision Hadoop clusters.</p>

<p>Beside that we are contributors to Ambari, we are so excited about the coming Apache Ambari 1.7.0 new <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=30755705">features</a> that we could not help and put together an <strong>early access</strong> <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-ambari/tree/1.7.0-ea">Ambari 1.7.0 Docker container</a>.</p>

<p>Give it a try, and provision an arbitrary number of Hadoop cluster on your laptop (or production environment), using our container and Ambari shell. Let us know how it works for you. Enjoy.</p>

<h3>Get the Docker container</h3>

<p>In case you don’t have Docker browse among our previous posts &ndash; we have a few posts about howto’s, examples and best practices in general for Docker and in particular about how to run the full Hadoop stack on Docker.</p>

<p><code>
docker pull sequenceiq/ambari:1.7.0-ea
</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Once you have the container you are almost ready to go &ndash; we always automate everything and <strong>over simplify</strong> Hadoop provisioning.</p>

<h3>Get ambari-functions</h3>

<p>Get the following <code>ambari-functions</code> <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-ambari/blob/1.7.0-ea/ambari-functions">file</a> from our GitHub.</p>

<p><code>
curl -Lo .amb j.mp/docker-ambari-170ea &amp;&amp; . .amb
</code></p>

<h3>Create your cluster</h3>

<p><code>
amb-deploy-cluster 4
</code></p>

<p><strong>Whaaat?</strong> No really, that’s it &ndash; we have just provisioned you a 4 node Hadoop cluster in less than 2 minutes. Docker, Apache Ambari and Ambari Shell combined is quite powerful, isn&rsquo;t it? You can always start playing with your desired services by changing the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/ambari-rest-client/tree/master/src/main/resources/blueprints">blueprints</a> &ndash; the full Hadoop stack is supported.</p>

<p>If you’d like to play around and understand how this works check our previous blog posts &ndash; a good start is this first post about one of our contribution, the <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/05/26/ambari-shell/">Ambari Shell</a>.</p>

<p>You have just seen how easy is to provision a Hadoop cluster on your laptop, if you’d like to see how we provision a Hadoop cluster in the cloud using the very same Docker image you can check our open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API &ndash; <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a>. Last week we have released a project called <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/27/announcing-periscope/">Periscope</a> &ndash; the industry&rsquo;s first open source autoscaling API for Hadoop.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/18/hadoop-2-5-0-docker/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-18T18:07:18+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/18/hadoop-2-5-0-docker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we have released an Apache Hadoop 2.3 Docker image &ndash; in a very short time this become the most <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=hadoop">popular</a> Hadoop image in the Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">registry</a>.</p>

<p>Following on the success of our Hadoop 2.3.0, 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/">image</a>, the feedbacks and requests we have received and aligning with the Hadoop release cycle, we have released an Apache Hadoop 2.5.0 Docker image &ndash; same as the previous version this is available as a trusted and automated build on the official Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">registry</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that beside this Hadoop image, we have released and maintain a <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/17/ambari-cluster-on-docker/">pseudo-distributed</a> and <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">fully distributed</a> Hadoop Docker image provisioned with Apache Ambari. As they are provisioned with Ambari you have the option to change, add and remove Hadoop components using cluster blueprints.</p>

<p>Also we are happy to let you know that this release of Apache Hadoop contains a few of SequenceIQ&rsquo;s open source <strong>contributions</strong> and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2250">fixes</a> around YARN schedulers.
We are working on an SLA enforcer for Hadoop &ndash; very soon to be open sourced &ndash; and part of that work we are contributing back to the community. Also there is a major contribution of ours coming in the next release of Hadoop &ndash; 2.6.0.
Stay tuned and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sequenceiq">Facebook</a>.</p>

<h2>Build the image</h2>

<p>In case you&rsquo;d like to try directly from the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker">Dockerfile</a> you can build the image as:</p>

<p><code>
docker build  -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker .
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Pull the image</h2>

<p>As it is also released as an official Docker image from Docker&rsquo;s automated build repository &ndash; you can always pull or refer the image when launching containers.</p>

<p><code>
docker pull sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.0
</code></p>

<h2>Start a container</h2>

<p>In order to use the Docker image you have just build or pulled use:</p>

<p><code>
docker run -i -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.0 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
</code></p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You can run one of the stock examples:</p>

<p>```
cd $HADOOP_PREFIX</p>

<h1>run the mapreduce</h1>

<p>bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.0.jar grep input output &lsquo;dfs[a-z.]+&rsquo;</p>

<h1>check the output</h1>

<p>bin/hdfs dfs -cat output/*
```</p>

<h2>Hadoop native libraries, build, Bintray, etc</h2>

<p>The Hadoop build process is no easy task &ndash; requires lots of libraries and their right version, protobuf, etc and takes some time &ndash; we have simplified all these, made the build and released a 64b version of Hadoop nativelibs on our <a href="https://bintray.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-bin/hadoop-native-64bit/2.4.1/view/files">Bintray repo</a>. Enjoy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently we’ve been asked an interesting question &ndash; how fair is the YARN <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html">FairScheduler</a> &ndash; while we never use internally the fair scheduler after a quick test the short answer is &ndash; <strong>very fair</strong>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we always use the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html">CapacityScheduler</a> &ndash; actually an enhanced version of it (coming with the 2.6.0 release of Hadoop). Since the emergence of YARN and the new schedulers we were working on a solution to bring SLA to Hadoop &ndash; and part of this work was our contribution to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1495">Apache YARN schedulers</a> and <a href="http://ambari.apache.org/">Apache Ambari</a>. Anyway, we decided to configure a FairScheduler in one of our 20 node test cluster and run a quick test.</p>

<h3>Fair scheduler</h3>

<p>Remember than before YARN only one resource represented a resource on a cluster &ndash; the <code>slot</code>. Every node had slots, and your MR job was taking up slots , regardless of their actual resource usage (CPU, memory). It worked but for sure it wasn’t a fair game &ndash; and caused lots of frustration between administrators of applications competing for <code>slots</code>. We have seen many over and undersubscribed nodes in terms of CPU and memory. YARN introduced the concept of containers and the ability to request/attach resources to them (vCores and memory).</p>

<p>While this seams already a big step forward comparing with slots, it brought up other problems &ndash; with multiple resources as <code>vCores</code> and <code>memory</code> and <code>disk</code> and <code>network i/o</code> in the future it’s pretty challenging to share them fairly. With a single resource it would we pretty straightforward &ndash; nevertheless the community based on a <a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Ghodsi.pdf">research paper</a> coming out from UC Berkeley (Ghodsi et al) managed to get this working through (again a community effort) this <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-326">YARN ticket</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s battle test how fair is the scheduler when running two MR application with changing resource usage &ndash; how well the dominant resource fairness works.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The test</h3>

<p>We decided to take a pretty easy MR job with 64 input files. In order to bring in some  variables, the input files are a multiple of 4MB, distributed as the smallest is 4MB and the largest is 256MB. The used <code>block size</code> is 256MB, and the number of nodes in the cluster is <strong>20</strong>. We are using and open sourced an <strong>R based</strong> <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring">YARN monitoring</a> project &ndash; feel free to use it and let us know if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>We were running two jobs &ndash; and the task&rsquo;s input was descending e.g. <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000001</em> has a 252MB input file and <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000063</em> has a 4MB input. Obliviously the tasks were not necessarily executed in this order, because the order depends on when the nodemanager asks for task.</p>

<p>See the <code>timeboxed</code> result of the two runs.</p>

<p><strong>Run 61</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run61.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Run 62</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run62.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While the <code>timeboxed</code> version will not really help to decide the resource usage and the elapsed time (which should be pretty much equal) it’s good to show the time spent on different nodes. Many times generating these charts helped us to identify hardware or other software/configuration issues on different nodes (for example when a run execution is outside of the standard deviation). You can use our R project and file to generate charts as such with the help of <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring/blob/master/RProjects/TimeBoxes.R">TimeBoxes.R</a> file.</p>

<p>Now if we compare the two execution files and place it on the same chart we will actually see that the FairScheduler is <strong>fairly Fair</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/test8_active_mapppers_num.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Random ideas</h3>

<p>While the purpose of these tests was to show that the fair scheduler distributes resources in a fair way &ndash; sorry I can’t help &ndash; we can see that the executions of the map tasks are not optimal, but at least stable. Also we can notice that the execution order depends also on the blocks locations; if you should know/consider the blocks location ahead the execution could be more optimal.</p>

<p>Measured a few other things as well &ndash; will discuss this on a different post &ndash; and from those charts you can see that the elapsed time of a task grow even as there are free slots.  Also as the number of mappers come closer to the available free slots of the cluster the average elapsed times of the tasks grow &ndash; due to different reasons (which we will share on a forthcoming post).</p>

<p>Since we are not really using the <strong>FairScheduler</strong> and we had one now configured we decided to run a few of our performance tests as well, and while submitting jobs like <code>crazy</code> using the fair scheduler we managed to <code>logjam</code> the cluster.
We have never seen this before while using the <strong>CapacityScheduler</strong> &ndash; and digging into details we figured that the FairScheduler is missing the <code>yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent</code> property. This <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1913">issue</a> appears to be a bug in the FairScheduler &ndash; fixed in the 2.5 release.</p>

<p>While we don’t want to make any comparison between the two schedulers I think that the FairScheduler is a very viable and good option for those having a cluster and doesn’t want to bother with <strong>capacity planning ahead</strong>. Also I was impressed by the fine grain rules which you can use with the FairScheduler while deciding on the resource allocations.</p>

<p>Note that we are working and open sourcing a project which brings SLA to Hadoop and allows auto-scaling using <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; our open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. The project is called <strong>Periscope</strong> and will be open sourced very soon.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T08:53:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this blog entry is to cover advanced topics regarding Docker networking and explain different concepts to inter-connect Docker containers when the containers are running on different host machines.
For the demonstration we are using VMs on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> launched with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, but the explained networking concepts work also on Amazon EC2 (with VPC) and Azure unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>To set up the the test environment clone the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples">SequenceIQ&rsquo;s samples repository</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@github.com:sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples.git
cd sequenceiq-samples/docker-networking
vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>The <code>vagrant up</code> command launches the test setup, which conatins two Ubuntu 14.04 VMs with the network configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat">NAT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">Private networking</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The NAT (related to eth0 interface on VMs) is used only for access the external network from VMs e.g. download files from debian repository, but it is not used for inter-container communication. The Vagrant sets up a properly configured Host Only Networking in VirtualBox therefore the VMs can communicate with each other on the defined IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 192.168.40.11</li>
<li>vm2: 192.168.40.12</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see how Docker containers running on these VMs can send IP packets to each other.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Setting up bridge0</h2>

<p>The Docker attaches all containers to the virtual subnet implemented by docker0, this means that by default on both VMs the Docker containers will be launched with IP addresses from range 172.17.42.1/24. This is a problem for some of the solutions explained below, because if the containers on different hosts have the same IP addresses then we won&rsquo;t be able to properly route the IP packets between them. Therefore on each VMs a network bridge is created with the following subnets:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 172.17.51.1/24</li>
<li>vm2: 172.17.52.1/24</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that every container luanched on vm1 will get an IP address from range 172.17.51.2 &ndash; 172.17.51.255 and containers on vm2 will have an address from range 172.17.52.2 &ndash; 172.17.52.255.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.51.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>sudo brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.52.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart
```</p>

<p>As noted in the comments the above configuration is already executed during the provisioning of VMs and it was copied here just for the sake of clarity and completeness.</p>

<h2>Expose container ports to host</h2>

<p>Probably the simplest way to solve inter-container communication is to expose ports from container to the host. This can be done with the <code>-p</code> switch. E.g. exposing the port 3333 is as simple as:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 -p 3333:3333 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>This might be well suited for cases when the communication ports are defined in advance (e.g. MySQL will run on port 3306), but will not work when the application uses dynamic ports for communication (like Hadoop does with IPC ports).</p>

<h2>Host networking</h2>

<p>If the container is started with <code>--net=host</code> then it avoids placing the container inside of a separate network stack, but as the Docker documentation says this option &ldquo;tells Docker to not containerize the container&rsquo;s networking&rdquo;. The <code>cont1</code> container can bind directly to the network interface of host therefore the <code>nc</code> will be available directly on 192.168.40.11.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 &mdash;net=host ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course if you want to access cont2 from cont1 then cont2 also needs to be started with <code>--net=host</code> option.
The host networking is very powerful solution for inter-container communication, but it has its drawbacks, since the ports used by the container can collide with the ports used by host or other containers utilising &mdash;net=host option, because all of them are sharing the same network stack.</p>

<h2>Direct Routing</h2>

<p>So far we have seen methods where the containers have used the IP address of host to communicate with each other, but there are solutions to inter-connect the containers by using their own IPs. If we are using the containers own IPs for routing then it is important that we shall be able to distinguish based on IP which container is running on vm1 and which one is running on on vm2, this was the reason why the bridge0 interface was created as explained in &ldquo;Setting up bridge0&rdquo; section.
To make the things a bit easier to understand I have created a simplified diagram of the network interfaces in our current test setup. If I would like to oversimplify the thing then I would say that, we shall setup the routing in that way that the packets from one container are following the red lines shown on the diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png</a>"></p>

<p>To achive this we need to configure the routing table on hosts in that way that every packet which destination is 172.17.51.0/24 is forwarded to vm1 and every IP packet where the destination is 172.17.52.0/24 is forwarded to vm2. To repeat it shortly, the containers running on vm1 are placed to subnet 172.17.51.0/24, containers on vm2 are on subnet 172.17.52.0/24.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.40.12
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0  netmask 255.255.255.0  gw 192.168.40.11
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>route add</code> command adds the desired routing to the route table, but you might wonder why the iptables configuration is necessary. The reason for that the Docker by default sets up a rule to the nat table to masquerade all IP packets that are leaving the machine. In our case we definitely don&rsquo;t want this, therefore we delete all MASQUERADE rules with -F option. At this point we already would be able to make the connection from one container to other and vice verse, but the containers would not be able to communicate with the outside world, therefore an iptables rule needs to be added to masquerade the packets that are going outside of 172.17.0.0/16. I need to mention the another approach would be to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/articles/networking/#between-containers">&mdash;iptables=false</a> option of the daemon to avoid any manipulation in the iptables and you can do all the config manually.</p>

<p>Such kind of direct routing from one vm to other vm works great and easy to set up, but cannot be used if the hosts are not on the same subnet. If the host are located the on different subnet the tunneling might be an option as you will see it in the next section.</p>

<p><em>Note: This solution works on Amazon EC2 instances only if the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck">Source/Destionation Check</a> is disabled.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: Due to the packet filtering policy of Azure this method cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel</h2>

<p>GRE is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links.
The main idea is to create a GRE tunnel between the VMs and send all traffic through it:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png</a>"></p>

<p>In order to create a tunnel you need to specify the name, the type (which is gre in our case) and the IP address of local and the remote end. Consequently the tun2 name used for the tunnel on on vm1 since from vm1 perspective that is the tunnel endpoint which leads to vm2 and every packet sent to tun2 to will eventually come out on vm2 end.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun2 mode gre local 192.168.40.11 remote 192.168.40.12
sudo ifconfig tun2 10.0.201.1
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun1 mode gre local 192.168.40.12 remote 192.168.40.11
sudo ifconfig tun1 10.0.202.1
sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>After the tunnel is set up and activated the remaining commands are very similar to the commands executed in the &ldquo;Direct Routing&rdquo; section. The main difference here is that we do not route the traffic directly to other vm, but we are routing it into <code>dev tun1</code> and <code>dev tun2</code> respectively.</p>

<p>With GRE tunnels a point-to-point connection is set up between two hosts, which means that if you have more then two hosts in your network and want to interconnect all of them, then n-1 tunnel endpoint needs to be created on every host, which will be quite challenging to maintain if you have a large cluster.</p>

<p><em>Note: GRE packets are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn133803.aspx">filtered out</a> on Azure therefore this solution cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>

<p>If more secured connections is required between containers then VPNs can be used on VMs. This addiotional security might significantly increase processing overhead. This overhead is highly depends on which VPN solution are you going to use. In this demo we use the VPN capabilities of SSH which is not really suited for production use. In order to enable the VPN capabilites of ssh the  PermitTunnel parameter needs to be switched on in sshd_config. If you are using the Vagranfile provided to this tutorial then nothing needs to be done, since this parameter was already set up for you during provisioning in the bootstrap.sh.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo ssh -f -N -w 2:1 <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x72;&#111;&#x6f;&#x74;&#64;&#49;&#x39;&#x32;&#x2e;&#x31;&#54;&#x38;&#46;&#x34;&#x30;&#46;&#49;&#50;">&#114;&#x6f;&#111;&#116;&#x40;&#x31;&#57;&#50;&#46;&#x31;&#x36;&#x38;&#x2e;&#52;&#x30;&#46;&#x31;&#x32;</a>
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The ssh is launched with -w option where the numerical ids of tun devices were specified. After executing the command the tunnel interfaces are created on both VMs. The interfaces needs to be be activated with ifconfig up and after that we need to setup the rooting to direct the traffic to  172.17.51.0/24 and 172.17.52.0/24 to tun2 and tun1.</p>

<p>As mentioned the VPN capabilities of SSH is not recommended in production, but other solutions like  <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> would worth a try to secure the communication between the hosts (and also between the containers).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The above examples were hand written mainly for demonstration purposes, but there are great tools like <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework">Pipework</a> that can make your life simpler and will do the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>If you want to check how these methods are working in production environment you are just a few clicks from it, since under the hood these methods are responsible to solve the inter-container communication in our cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a>.</p>
