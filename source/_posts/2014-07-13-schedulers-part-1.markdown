CapacityScheduler is the default scheduler that ships with Hadoop. Its purpose is to allow multi-tenancy and share resources between
multiple organizations on the same cluster. You can read the high level abstraction
[here](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.3.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html). In this blog entry we'll examine it
from a technical point of view (the implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/tree/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity))
as part of the ResourceManager.

## Configuration

It all begins with the configuration. The scheduler consists of a queue hierarchy, something like this
(except itâ€™s xml ah.. capacity-scheduler.xml):
```
yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent=0.2
yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications=10000
yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay=40
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.acl_administer_queue=*
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.capacity=100
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.acl_administer_jobs=*
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.acl_submit_applications=*
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.capacity=80
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.maximum-capacity=80
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.state=RUNNING
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.user-limit-factor=1
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.acl_administer_jobs=*
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.acl_submit_applications=*
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.capacity=20
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.maximum-capacity=40
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.state=RUNNING
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.low.user-limit-factor=1
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues=default,low
```

{% img http://yuml.me/9d7e9977 %}

Be careful when determining the queue capacities, because if you mess it up the ResourceManager won't start `(Service RMActiveServices
failed in state INITED; cause: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal capacity of 1.1 for children of queue root)`. The
[initScheduler](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity/CapacityScheduler.java#L255)
will parse the configuration file and create either [parent](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity/ParentQueue.java)
or [leaf](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity/LeafQueue.java)
queues and compute their capabilities.

```
capacity.LeafQueue (LeafQueue.java:setupQueueConfigs(312)) - Initializing default
capacity = 0.8 [= (float) configuredCapacity / 100 ]
asboluteCapacity = 0.8 [= parentAbsoluteCapacity * capacity ]
maxCapacity = 0.8 [= configuredMaxCapacity ]
absoluteMaxCapacity = 0.8 [= 1.0 maximumCapacity undefined, (parentAbsoluteMaxCapacity * maximumCapacity) / 100 otherwise ]
userLimit = 100 [= configuredUserLimit ]
userLimitFactor = 1.0 [= configuredUserLimitFactor ]
maxApplications = 8000 [= configuredMaximumSystemApplicationsPerQueue or (int)(configuredMaximumSystemApplications * absoluteCapacity)]
maxApplicationsPerUser = 8000 [= (int)(maxApplications * (userLimit / 100.0f) * userLimitFactor) ]
maxActiveApplications = 1 [= max((int)ceil((clusterResourceMemory / minimumAllocation) * maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent * absoluteMaxCapacity),1) ]
maxActiveAppsUsingAbsCap = 1 [= max((int)ceil((clusterResourceMemory / minimumAllocation) *maxAMResourcePercent * absoluteCapacity),1) ]
maxActiveApplicationsPerUser = 1 [= max((int)(maxActiveApplications * (userLimit / 100.0f) * userLimitFactor),1) ]
usedCapacity = 0.0 [= usedResourcesMemory / (clusterResourceMemory * absoluteCapacity)]
absoluteUsedCapacity = 0.0 [= usedResourcesMemory / clusterResourceMemory]
maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent = 0.2 [= configuredMaximumAMResourcePercent ]
minimumAllocationFactor = 0.75 [= (float)(maximumAllocationMemory - minimumAllocationMemory) / maximumAllocationMemory ]
numContainers = 0 [= currentNumContainers ]
state = RUNNING [= configuredState ]
acls = ADMINISTER_QUEUE: SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS:* [= configuredAcls ]
nodeLocalityDelay = 40
```
Although it does not imply, but application submission is only allowed to leaf queues. By default all application is submitted to
a queue called `default`. One interesting property is the `schedule-asynchronously` which I'll talk about later.

## Messaging

Once the ResourceManager is up and running, the messaging starts. Mostly everything happens via events. These events are distributed with
a [dispatcher](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/event/AsyncDispatcher.java)
among the registered event handlers. It's hard to follow the flow, because events can come from everywhere. The CapacityScheduler itself
is registered for many events, and act based on these events. Code snippets are from branch `trunk` aka `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
```java
 @Override
  public void handle(SchedulerEvent event) {
    switch(event.getType()) {
    case NODE_ADDED:
    {
      NodeAddedSchedulerEvent nodeAddedEvent = (NodeAddedSchedulerEvent)event;
      addNode(nodeAddedEvent.getAddedRMNode());
      recoverContainersOnNode(nodeAddedEvent.getContainerReports(),
        nodeAddedEvent.getAddedRMNode());
    }
    break;
    case NODE_REMOVED:
    {
      NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent nodeRemovedEvent = (NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent)event;
      removeNode(nodeRemovedEvent.getRemovedRMNode());
    }
    break;
    case NODE_UPDATE:
    {
      NodeUpdateSchedulerEvent nodeUpdatedEvent = (NodeUpdateSchedulerEvent)event;
      RMNode node = nodeUpdatedEvent.getRMNode();
      nodeUpdate(node);
      if (!scheduleAsynchronously) {
        allocateContainersToNode(getNode(node.getNodeID()));
      }
    }
    break;
    case APP_ADDED:
    {
      AppAddedSchedulerEvent appAddedEvent = (AppAddedSchedulerEvent) event;
      addApplication(appAddedEvent.getApplicationId(),
        appAddedEvent.getQueue(), appAddedEvent.getUser());
    }
    break;
    case APP_REMOVED:
    {
      AppRemovedSchedulerEvent appRemovedEvent = (AppRemovedSchedulerEvent)event;
      doneApplication(appRemovedEvent.getApplicationID(),
        appRemovedEvent.getFinalState());
    }
    break;
    case APP_ATTEMPT_ADDED:
    {
      AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent appAttemptAddedEvent =
          (AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent) event;
      addApplicationAttempt(appAttemptAddedEvent.getApplicationAttemptId(),
        appAttemptAddedEvent.getTransferStateFromPreviousAttempt(),
        appAttemptAddedEvent.getShouldNotifyAttemptAdded());
    }
    break;
    case APP_ATTEMPT_REMOVED:
    {
      AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent appAttemptRemovedEvent =
          (AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent) event;
      doneApplicationAttempt(appAttemptRemovedEvent.getApplicationAttemptID(),
        appAttemptRemovedEvent.getFinalAttemptState(),
        appAttemptRemovedEvent.getKeepContainersAcrossAppAttempts());
    }
    break;
    case CONTAINER_EXPIRED:
    {
      ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent containerExpiredEvent =
          (ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent) event;
      ContainerId containerId = containerExpiredEvent.getContainerId();
      completedContainer(getRMContainer(containerId),
          SchedulerUtils.createAbnormalContainerStatus(
              containerId,
              SchedulerUtils.EXPIRED_CONTAINER),
          RMContainerEventType.EXPIRE);
    }
    break;
    default:
      LOG.error("Invalid eventtype " + event.getType() + ". Ignoring!");
    }
  }
```

### NODE_ADDED
Each time a node joins to the cluster the [ResourceTrackerService](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/ResourceTrackerService.java#L237)
registers the `NodeManager` and as part of the transition sends a `NodeAddedSchedulerEvent`. The scheduler keeps track of
the global cluster resources and adds the node's resources to the global.
```
Added node amb1.mycorp.kom:45454 clusterResource: <memory:5120, vCores:8>
Added node amb2.mycorp.kom:45454 clusterResource: <memory:10240, vCores:16>
```
It is also needed to update all the queue metrics since the cluster got bigger, thus the queue capacities also change. More likely to happen
that a new application can be scheduled. If the `isWorkPreservingRecoveryEnabled` is enabled on the `ResourceManager` it can recover
containers on a re-joining node.
### NODE_REMOVED
There can be many reasons that a node is being removed from the cluster, but the scenario is almost the same as adding one. A
`NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent` is sent and the scheduler subtracts the node's resources from the global and updates all the queue metrics.
Things can be a little bit complicated since the node was active part of the resource scheduling and can have running containers and
reserved resources. The scheduler will kill these containers and notify the applications so they can request new containers and
unreserves the resources.
```
rmnode.RMNodeImpl (RMNodeImpl.java:transition(569)) - Deactivating Node amb4.mycorp.kom:45454 as it is now DECOMMISSIONED
rmnode.RMNodeImpl (RMNodeImpl.java:handle(385)) - amb4.mycorp.kom:45454 Node Transitioned from RUNNING to DECOMMISSIONED
capacity.CapacityScheduler (CapacityScheduler.java:removeNode(980)) - Removed node amb4.mycorp.kom:45454 clusterResource: <memory:15360, vCores:24>
```
### APP_ADDED
On application [submission](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/RMAppManager.java#L266)
an `AppAddedSchedulerEvent` is made and the scheduler will decide to accept the application or not. It depends whether it
was submitted to a leaf queue and the user have the appropriate rights (ACL) to submit to this queue and the queue can have more applications. If
any of these fails the scheduler will reject the application by sending an `RMAppRejectedEvent`. Otherwise it will register a new
`SchedulerApplication` and notify the target queue's parents about it and updates the queue metrics.
```
capacity.ParentQueue (ParentQueue.java:addApplication(495)) - Application added - appId: application_1405323437551_0001 user: hdfs leaf-queue of parent: root #applications: 1
capacity.CapacityScheduler (CapacityScheduler.java:addApplication(544)) - Accepted application application_1405323437551_0001 from user: hdfs, in queue: default
```
### APP_REMOVED
The analogy is the same as between `NODE_ADDED` and `NODE_REMOVED`. Updates the queue metrics and notifies the parent's that and
application finished, removes the application and sets its final state.
### APP_ATTEMPT_ADDED
After the `APP_ADDED` event the application is in `inactive` mode. It means it won`t get any resources scheduled for it. Only by attempting
to run it. One application can have many attempts as it can fail for many reasons.
```
rmapp.RMAppImpl (RMAppImpl.java:handle(639)) - application_1405323437551_0001 State change from SUBMITTED to ACCEPTED
resourcemanager.ApplicationMasterService (ApplicationMasterService.java:registerAppAttempt(611)) - Registering app attempt : appattempt_1405323437551_0001_000001
attempt.RMAppAttemptImpl (RMAppAttemptImpl.java:handle(659)) - appattempt_1405323437551_0001_000001 State change from NEW to SUBMITTED
capacity.LeafQueue (LeafQueue.java:activateApplications(763)) - Application application_1405323437551_0001 from user: hdfs activated in queue: default
capacity.LeafQueue (LeafQueue.java:addApplicationAttempt(779)) - Application added - appId: application_1405323437551_0001 user: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.LeafQueue$User@46a224a4, leaf-queue: default #user-pending-applications: 0 #user-active-applications: 1 #queue-pending-applications: 0 #queue-active-applications: 1
capacity.CapacityScheduler (CapacityScheduler.java:addApplicationAttempt(567)) - Added Application Attempt appattempt_1405323437551_0001_000001 to scheduler from user hdfs in queue default
```
Attempt states are transferred from one to another. By sending an `AppAttemptAddedSchedulerEvent` the scheduler actually tries to allocate
resources. First, the application goes into the pending applications list of the queue and if the queue limits allows it,
it goes into the active applications list. This active application list is the one that the queue uses when trying to allocate resources.
It works in FIFO order, but I'll elaborate on it in the `NODE_UPDATE` part.
### APP_ATTEMPT_REMOVED
On `AppAttemptRemovedSchedulerEvent` the scheduler cleans up after the application. Releases all the allocated, acquired, running containers
(In case of `ApplicationMaster` restart the running containers won't get killed), releases all reserved containers,
cleans up pending requests and informs the queues.
```
rmapp.RMAppImpl (RMAppImpl.java:handle(639)) - application_1405323437551_0001 State change from FINISHING to FINISHED
capacity.CapacityScheduler (CapacityScheduler.java:doneApplicationAttempt(598)) - Application Attempt appattempt_1405323437551_0001_000001 is done. finalState=FINISHED
scheduler.AppSchedulingInfo (AppSchedulingInfo.java:clearRequests(108)) - Application application_1405323437551_0001 requests cleared
capacity.LeafQueue (LeafQueue.java:removeApplicationAttempt(821)) - Application removed - appId: application_1405323437551_0001 user: hdfs queue: default #user-pending-applications: 0 #user-active-applications: 0 #queue-pending-applications: 0 #queue-active-applications: 0
amlauncher.AMLauncher (AMLauncher.java:run(262)) - Cleaning master appattempt_1405323437551_0001_000001
```
### NODE_UPDATE

TODO

### CONTAINER_EXPIRED
The [ContainerAllocationExpirer's](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/rmcontainer/ContainerAllocationExpirer.java)
responsibility to check if a container expires and when it does it sends an `ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent` and the scheduler
will notify the application to remove the container from its list. The value of how long to wait until a container is considered dead can
be configured.
