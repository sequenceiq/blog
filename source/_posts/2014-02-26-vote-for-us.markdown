**Moving to Hadoop 2.0/YARN at SequenceIQ**

A showcase of our efforts to bring all our Hadoop based applications under one common cluster management framework - YARN. 
Our deployment consists of MR2, HBase, Mahout and Hive-all running within one single auto-scaling cluster. We have faced many challenges such as load imbalances, SLA misses, cluster scheduling and VM container deployments - and would like to share our struggle and solution with the community. 
As a startup, cost savings is important for us - switching to Hadoop 2.0 helped us save significant costs through better utilization of our hardware and cloud VMs. Our decision and investment of moving to YARN has paid off - and opened up new business and technical opportunities.
